== Welcome to WEBDIR

  Webdir is a simple webinterface to upload and maintain files on a webserver
  
== QUICKSTART

  * Create a VirtualHost or start the server of the webdir rails application
  * Create the User's webdirfiles directory and configure at the bottom of 
    config/environment.rb
    
  Create a Userdir example:
    mkdir -p /home/USERNAME/files/webdirfiles
  
  optional at user creation:
    htpasswd -c /home/USERNAME/files/webdirfiles/.webdirusers admin
    htpasswd /home/USERNAME/files/webdirfiles/.webdirusers other_users

  If optional steps not done the user is able to log in as user admin
  with password admin for the first time and will be redirected and 
  forced to change the password.
  
  
== CONFIG AND USAGE NOTES

  webdir will not create the files-directory for a new user.
  Sysadmin must
    mkdir USER_HOMES/USER_HTML_DIR/webdirfiles
    chown apache USER_HOMES/USER_HTML_DIR/webdirfiles
    
  Where USER_HOMES and USER_HTML_DIR is defined in environments.rb such like
  
  USER_HOMES = "/mnt/raid1/Users"
  USER_HTML_DIR = 'files'
   
  This config will search files in: /mnt/raid1/Users/USERNAME/files/webdirfiles
  where USERNAME is the name given at the address of
  
  http://your.server.somewhere/USERNAME
  
  USERNAME will be stored as cookie and webir will search for a file named
  /mnt/raid1/Users/USERNAME/files/webdirfiles/.webdirusers
  which is a standard htpasswd-generated file.
  
  if .webdirusers will not be find the first-time log in will be 
  
  admin/admin
  
  You have to change the password admin to something more secure or will not
  be able to leave the 'set password form'.
